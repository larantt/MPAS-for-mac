# MPAS-for-mac
Details and notes from my attempts to run MPAS on a 2020 MacBook Pro (i-5 core 16 GB on Sequoia 15.5)

In here I detail how I built the required libraries and provide some rough shell scripts demonstrating how one might
run MPAS on a MacBook Pro. The majority of the output is designed to follow the [2025 MPAS Tutorial](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas/tutorial/Virtual2025/), though as I did not attend and had other datasets downloaded from previous work and memory constraints on my laptop, I use some of my own ERA5 data and the CFSR test data provided in the user guide.
